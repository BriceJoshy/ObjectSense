# This file shows the basics of reading data from the csv file
# : At first, the CSV file is opened using the open() method in ‘r’ mode(specifies read mode while opening a file)
# which returns the file object then it is read by using the reader() method of CSV module
# that returns the reader object that iterates throughout the lines in the specified CSV document.
# The ‘with’ keyword is used along with the open() method as it simplifies exception handling and automatically closes the CSV file.
